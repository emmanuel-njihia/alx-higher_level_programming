What's a Database?
A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for efficient access, retrieval, and management. It provides a way to store, organize, and manage large amounts of data, making it easier to retrieve specific information and perform complex operations.

What's a Relational Database?
A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables consisting of rows and columns. It establishes relationships between tables using keys, enabling efficient data retrieval and enforcing data integrity. The relationships between tables allow for complex querying and analysis of data.

What Does SQL Stand For?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL provides a set of commands and syntax for creating, modifying, and retrieving data from databases.

What's MySQL?
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its query language. It is widely used for various applications and is known for its performance, reliability, and ease of use. MySQL supports multiple platforms and offers features like data replication, transactional support, and user management.

How to Create a Database in MySQL
To create a database in MySQL, you can use the following SQL command:

CREATE DATABASE database_name;
Replace database_name with the desired name for your database. This command creates a new database with the specified name.

What Does DDL and DML Stand For?
DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It consists of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes, and constraints. Common DDL commands include CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It comprises SQL commands used to manipulate and retrieve data within the database. Common DML commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

How to CREATE or ALTER a Table
To create a table in MySQL, you can use the following SQL command:

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
Replace table_name with the desired name for your table. Specify the columns and their datatypes within the parentheses.

To alter an existing table in MySQL, you can use the ALTER TABLE statement along with specific commands to add, modify, or delete columns and constraints.

How to SELECT Data from a Table
To retrieve data from a table in MySQL, you can use the SELECT statement. Here's an example:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Replace column1, column2, ... with the desired columns to retrieve. Specify the table_name from which to select data. You can also use the WHERE clause to add conditions for filtering the data.

How to INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE Data
To insert data into a table, you can use the INSERT INTO statement. Here's an example:
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
Replace table_name with the name of the table and specify the values for each column.

To update existing data in a table, you can use the UPDATE statement. Here's an example:
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
Replace table_name with the name of the table and specify the columns to update along with their new values. Use the WHERE clause to add conditions for updating specific rows.

To delete data from a table, you can use the DELETE FROM statement. Here's an example:
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Replace table_name with the name of the table. Use the WHERE clause to specify the condition for deleting specific rows.

What Are Subqueries?
Subqueries, also known as nested queries, are SQL queries placed within another query. They allow you to use the result of one query as input for another query. Subqueries can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements. They are useful for complex filtering, calculations, and retrieving data from related tables.

How to Use MySQL Functions
MySQL provides a wide range of built-in functions for performing calculations, manipulating data, and formatting output. Functions can be used in SQL statements to modify data or retrieve computed values. Examples of MySQL functions include CONCAT, SUBSTRING, DATE_FORMAT, and COUNT. You can refer to the MySQL documentation for a comprehensive list of functions and their usage.
